          <h1>Android Sensing API</h1>

          <h3>Overview</h3> 
          <p>All control of sensors data collection is done via the <a href="https://github.com/xsenselabs/SensorManager/blob/master/src/com/ubhave/sensormanager/ESSensorManager.java" target="_blank">ESSensorManager singleton</a>. This instance manages all the sensing threads and starts, stops, and modifies them as required by the application: this ensures that data is only collected when it is required. The singleton supports two kinds of data collection (below).

          <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
          <p>These libraries use the following design patterns.</p>

          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_blank">Singleton Managers</a>. To enforce uniformity, control global state (e.g., configuration parameters), and allow threads to service more than one data request, our libraries use a central singleton that mediates all interaction with the library.</p>

          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern" target="_blank">Publish-Subscribe Interaction</a>. Tasks that require background processing were designed as a publish-subscribe message passing system, where applications only need to subscribe to the relevant component and react when data or events are pushed to them. Doing so allowed us to both separate each library’s function from the application that requires it, as well as reduce the amount of computation that each library needs to do in those cases where multiple subscribers need the same functionalities.</p>

          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair" target="_blank">Key-Value Configuration</a>. All of the libraries’ configuration settings can be set and retrieved as key-value pairs, regardless of their type. Moreover, when non-critical configuration parameters are not explicitly set, the libraries fall back on a set of default values.</p>

          <h3>Identifying Sensors</h3> 
          <p>Each sensor in the library is assigned a numeric identifier. These are listed in <code>com.ubhave.sensormanager.sensors.SensorUtils.java</code>.

          <h3>Permissions</h3> 
          <p>Most sensors require a particular permission to be added to the application, which users must agree to when installing the app. Naturally, the sensing library cannot and does not capture data from those sensors that the application has not requested permission for.

          <h3>Sampling Sensor Data</h3>
          <p>The first is one-off sampling, which is implemented as a blocking call, and reduces collecting sensor data to two lines of code. For example, a sample of data with the default configuration can be retrieved by getting the singleton <code>getSensorManager(...)</code> and then requesting data with <code>getDataFromSensor()</code>. For example, to retrieve a sample of Accelerometer data with the default configuration:</p>

<pre><code>ESSensorManager sm = ESSensorManager.getSensorManager(context);AccelerometerData d = (AccelerometerData) sm.getDataFromSensor(SensorUtils.SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);return d.getSensorReadings();
</code></pre>

<h3>Subscribing to Sensor Data</h3>
<p>The second is the publish-subscribe model: subscriptions are given a unique identifier which can then be used to pause and unsubscribe them. When collecting data in this way, application developers need to implement two methods. The first is <code>onDataSensed(...)</code>, which implements what do to with the data when it has been pushed to the application; the second is <code>onCrossingLowBatteryThreshold(...)</code>. Most crucially, this latter method directly exposes and, in doing so, guides the application developer to implement actions that should be taken when the battery is low.

<h3>Storing and Transmitting Data</h3>
<p>The second is the publish-subscribe model: subscriptions are given a unique identifier which can then be used to pause and unsubscribe them. When collecting data in this way, application developers need to implement two methods. The first is <code>onDataSensed(...)</code>, which implements what do to with the data when it has been pushed to the application; the second is <code>onCrossingLowBatteryThreshold(...)</code>. Most crucially, this latter method directly exposes and, in doing so, guides the application developer to implement actions that should be taken when the battery is low.
